# Wire

Simple routing for Ring.

The goals of Wire are:

  * use data to describes routes (not wrapped functions)
  * route contexts
  * route metadata (they're just maps)
  * path generation
  * simple *function* helpers
  * support standard Ring interface
  * separate identification-of route and execution-of matched handler

## Usage

Route definitions are maps:

```clojure
(def my-route
  {:path "/:id"
   :rules {:id #"[0-9]+"}
   :name :item
   :method :get
   :handler (fn [request])
   :pre [pre-dispatch-predicates ...]})
```

A route can be compiled:

```clojure
(wire.routes/compile-route my-route)
```

Compiling the route simply adds a new key to the map called :matcher, which is a compiled Clout Route.

To match a compiled route and execute it:

```clojure
(let [[matched-route path-params] (wire.dispatch/dispatch [my-route] request)]
  ((:handler matched-route) (assoc request :path-params path-params)))
```

### Helpers

Wire provides a few helpers for building routes. The helpers include *functions* for building routes based off of a request method and for adding context.

#### Arguments

An argument to `context` or any of the method helpers (GET,POST etc.) can take on a few forms:

```clojure
(defn my-handler [request])

;; string
(GET "/" my-handler)
{:method :get, :path "/", :handler my-handler}

;; keyword
(GET :root handler)
{:method :get, :name :root, :handler my-handler}

;; vector
(GET ["/:id" :id #"[0-9]+"] my-handler)
{:method :get, :rules {:id #"[0-9]+"}, :path "/:id", :handler my-handler}

;; map
(GET {:name :xyz :path ["/:id" :id #"[0-9]+"]} my-handler)
{:method :get, :name :xyz, :path "/:id", :rules {:id #"[0-9]+"}, :handler my-handler}
```

Here's a small example:

```clojure
(def app-routes
  (context "/"
    (GET my-handler)
    (GET "contact" render-contact)
    (GET [":page.html" :page #".+"] render-page)
    (context {:path "/admin" :pre [auth-check]}
      (GET "dashboard" render-admin-dashboard)
      (GET {:name :admin-stats
            :path "stats/:view"
            :rules {:view #".+"}
            :handler view-stats}))))
```

The result of which is a single-level vector of route map definitions:
```clojure
[{:path "/admin/dashboard" :handler render-admin-dashboard ...}
 {:path "/:page.html" :rules {:page #".+"} ...}]
```

Notice that the routes have carried the context so that the path contains the prefix. The route helpers will concatenate the :path, :rules and any :pre functions of the context. Subsequent context calls will continue this process so that context is always concatenated or passed through. 

All other context keys are passed through, but the route defs override anything else when a value is present.

#### Names and path generation
Routes can contain a :name key. The route example above contains a route with a name, :root. This name can be used later for finding a route, and building a path according to its path signature. Wire provides a helper for building paths:

```clojure
(path-for app-routes :admin-stats {:view "overview"})
;; "/admin/stats/overview"
```

### Middleware

In order to make use of the route definitions and dispatch within a Ring application, the routes will first need to be compiled:

```clojure
(def compiled-app-routes (compile-routes app-routes))
```

#### Dispatching

The dispatching in Wire is done in two steps.

##### Route identification

First, a suitable route is identified by asking the following questions:

  * do all of the pre-conditions return true?
  * does the request method match?
  * does the route path match?

If a route is not matched, then Wire applies these same rules to the next route in the sequence. If a route is matched, it's injected into the request map.

##### Handler execution

At the end of the stack is middleware for handling the execution of the matched route's handler function.

Here's the basic skeleton:

```clojure
(def my-ring-app
  (-> middle/exec-matched-route
      (middle/wrap-match compiled-app-routes)))
```

## Delayed :pre and :handler resolution

It's possible to model routes without injecting functions, and instead map their :handler and :pre values to something at request-time. Here's an example:

```clojure
(def my-routes
  (context {:path "/" :pre [:https?]}
    (GET :render-root)))

(middleware/wrap-match
  my-routes
  {:https? (fn [r] (= :https (:request-method r)))}
  {:render-root (fn [r] {:body "root"})})
```
